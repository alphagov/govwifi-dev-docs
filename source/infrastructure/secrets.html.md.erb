# Get started using secrets

Secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager. You will need to be on-boarded to GovWifi's AWS Staging and Production accounts in order to access these secrets.

## Secrets Manager

Once you have access to the AWS console, navigate to the Secrets Manager service in AWS.

The relevant credentials are listed in the following format: `<service>/<item>`.

## Pass & GPG

All other sensitive information (such as private IP addresses) are stored in [govwifi-build](https://github.com/GovWifi/govwifi-build/tree/master). This information is pulled in when terraform is run.

All shell commands assume you are running from within the [`govwifi-terraform`][govwifi-terraform]
repository since the [govwifi-build][govwifi-build] repository is cloned in the
`.private` directory of [`govwifi-terraform`][govwifi-terraform].

### GPG Tools

To use these secrets, you will need the [Password Store][passwordstore] tool installed on your machine and an environment variable to point to the location of the store, e.g. Macbook CLI

```
echo export PASSWORD_STORE_DIR="/Users/[YOUR_USERNAME]]/[PATH_TO]/govwifi-build/passwords" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Execute the updated .bashrc e.g.

```
. ~/.bashrc ; echo $PASSWORD_STORE_DIR
```

You will also need an implementation of `gpg` installed. This will be installable under the name `gnupg`:

```
apt/brew/dnf/rpm/yum install gnupg
```

### Getting access

Once you have installed the tools, you will need someone to re-encrypt the secrets with your public key.

Give someone your full key ID:

```sh
gpg --list-keys '<name>@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk'
```

An example of a key ID is: `06D20CF70AC370DE72F49EDC992939FDD5C5144C`

Please also ensure your public key is on a well known keyserver:

We suggest `keyserver.ubuntu.com` as they are known to be reliable.

```sh
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys '<your key ID>'
```

### Giving Access

The new joiner must first send their GPG key ID to a current member of the team.

Once the key is received, all team members must use the `receive-keys` option to accept it and provide the key with `ultimate` trust:

```sh
key_id='<their key ID>'
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --receive-keys "$key_id"
echo "${key_id}:6" | gpg --import-ownertrust
```

To on-board the new GPG key, navigate to the `.private` directory in the `govwifi-terraform` project.

Checkout a new branch in `.private`:

```sh
$ git checkout -b onboarding_<NAME>_GPG_key
```

Append the new key to the `.private/passwords/.gpg-id` file:

```sh
echo "$key_id" >> '.private/passwords/.gpg-id'
```

Change directory to the root project (`govwifi-terraform/`), then re-encrypt the passwords from within the [`govwifi-terraform`][govwifi-terraform] repo:

```sh
make rencrypt-passwords
```

Note: `make` commands can only be run from the root project directory.

There can be a number of reason for this to fail, for example one of the keys could have expired, if that's the case, contact the owner of the key and ask them to extned their expiration date and reupload their key to the server.

To extend key expiry
```sh
$ gpg --list-keys
$ gpg --edit-key KEYID`
> expire
> 2y
> y
> trust
> 5
> save <-- Very important!
```
then upload the key again.

Once the secrets have been re-encrypted, use git to add, commit and push the changes in the `.private` directory.

Raise a PR in the `govwifi-build` repo on Github. Ask another team member to test the encryption has worked by checking out the PR branch and testing they can decrypt the files using `gpg -d`.

#### New members

New members must import all the existing gpg keys that are stored.

To do this read in all the keys in `passwords/.gpg-id` and import them:

```
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --receive-keys <key_id> && gpg --import-ownertrust
```

If you are a new starter you'll have to do this for every team members key, so to speed things up, 'cat' out the keys and use the output in the receive-keys command.
```sh
# get all the keys
cat .gpg-id | tr '\n' ' '
# paste the output to.
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --receive-keys <keys> && gpg --import-ownertrust
```

### Getting a secret

Throughout the documentation there will be references to specific secrets stored within the password store.

To read individual secrets, run the command:

```sh
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=<password_store_dir> pass show <secret_name>
```

where:

1. `<password_store_dir>` is the path of the `passwords` directory of the
[govwifi-build](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build) repository on your
local machine.

2. `<secret_name>` is the path of the secret that you want to display. You can omit
   this to get a list of all secret paths.

For example, if you want to access the Staging Bastion SSH Key:

```sh
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=.private/passwords pass show keys/govwifi-staging-bastion-key
```

[passwordstore]: https://www.passwordstore.org/
[govwifi-terraform]: https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform
[govwifi-build]: https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build

### Adding/Editing a secret

Use `pass` to edit your file for ease - you can be anywhere when you do this - the <secret_name> is the dir/file path from the <password_store_dir>

```
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=<password_store_dir> pass edit <secret_name>
```

Example:

```
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=~/govwifi-build/passwords pass edit your_secret.txt
```

Make your changes and save them. They will be re-encrypted automatically if all your gpg keys are up to date.
