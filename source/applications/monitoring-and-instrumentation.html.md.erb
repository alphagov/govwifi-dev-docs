# Monitoring and Logging

Generally, this is done with the AWS tooling. There is information in
ECS about resource usage, and further information in Cloudwatch. We also log application errors to [Sentry].

Please see the [Monitoring page for infrastructure](https://dev-docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/infrastructure/monitoring.html#monitoring) for specific information around this topic.

## Admin app

Additionally, requests that pass through the load balancer for the
Admin app are recorded in an S3 bucket.

These logs are queryable through AWS Athena, for example to find
requests that resulted in a 504 response.
