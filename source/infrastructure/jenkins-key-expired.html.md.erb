# Renew the Jenkins GPG key

**Note**: GovWifi no longer uses Jenkins, the naming of the GPG key is a relic of when the team maintained a Jenkins pipeline.

If you see an error stating that this key has expired, please contact the GovWifi SREs.

You may encounter this error when trying to re-encrypt the secrets in [govwifi-build](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build) or in output of one of our Concourse pipelines - [like the `sync-frontend-certs` pipeline](https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering/teams/govwifi/pipelines/sync-frontend-certs).

If you are a member of the SRE team and you are looking for further documentation, please review [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xFh1ZSAnw5o-MN5rP8BRz0701AlJ4rWXG3jY7YNWjY/edit).
