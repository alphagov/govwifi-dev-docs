# Test FreeRADIUS on the ECS task level

If you need to test the new FreeRADIUS ECS tasks manually (e.g. when the new Environmnet is created and Smoke tests are not deployed yet) you can use the steps listed below.

## Prerequsites

We will be using the ECS Exec so please ensure your machine is configured in line with the prerequisites listed, [you can check your machines prerequisites here](https://dev-docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/infrastructure/access-ecs-tasks.html) and you are connected to the VPN.

## Get list of the FreeRADIUS tasks

You can check the FreeRADIUS task ID directly from the AWS Console or use following `gds-cli` command:

```
gds-cli aws <account-name> --region eu-west-2 -- aws ecs list-tasks --cluster frontend-fargate --service-name load-balanced-frontend
```

## Connect to the FreeRADIUS tasks

Use the task ID obtained in the previous step and run the following command to estabilish ssh session to the task using the instructions on the [Access ECS Tasks page of this manual]( https://dev-docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/infrastructure/access-ecs-tasks.html#access-ecs-tasks-with-ecs-exec)

## Check the healthcheck’s config file name

### Command:
```
ls -l /tmp/healthcheckpeap-mschapv2.conf.*
```

### An example output:
```
-rw-------    1 root     root           393 May 11 13:41 /tmp/healthcheckpeap-mschapv2.conf.erb20230511-20-8hrusp
```

You need to make a note of the full path of listed filename as it will be used in the command in the next step (e.g. /tmp/healthcheckpeap-mschapv2.conf.erb20230511-20-8hrusp)

## Run the Healthcheck test locally

You need to update the command with the name of healtcheck file captured in the previous step:

```
eapol_test -c /tmp/healthcheckpeap-mschapv2.conf.erb_random_string_here -s $HEALTH_CHECK_RADIUS_KEY
```

e.g.

```
eapol_test -c /tmp/healthcheckpeap-mschapv2.conf.erb20230511-20-8hrusp -s $HEALTH_CHECK_RADIUS_KEY
```

## Desired result output

```
EAPOL: SUPP_PAE entering state AUTHENTICATED
EAPOL: SUPP_BE entering state RECEIVE
EAPOL: SUPP_BE entering state SUCCESS
EAPOL: SUPP_BE entering state IDLE
eapol_sm_cb: result=1
EAPOL: Successfully fetched key (len=32)
PMK from EAPOL - hexdump(len=32): 12 23 45 78 90 12 34 56 ......
No EAP-Key-Name received from server
WPA: Clear old PMK and PTK
EAP: deinitialize previously used EAP method (25, PEAP) at EAP deinit
ENGINE: engine deinit
MPPE keys OK: 1  mismatch: 0
SUCCESS
```

## Healthchecks credential explained

`HEALTH_CHECK_IDENTITY` and `HEALTH_CHECK_PASSWORD` secrets are passed to the healtcheck from the Environmnet variables (you can check these using `export` command in the console).

`HEALTH_CHECK_RADIUS_KEY` is also passed from the Environmnet variables. It must match the secret injected to the FreeRADIUS configuration in Line 1 of following config file:

`/etc/raddb/certs/clients.conf`
