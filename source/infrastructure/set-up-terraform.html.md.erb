# Set up Terraform

GovWifi infrastructure is managed using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) which is configured via [govwifi-terraform](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform).

### Prerequisites

There are several prerequisites to running [govwifi-terraform](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform) `make` commands successfully:

- Your GPG key ID has been added to [govwifi-build](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build/blob/master/passwords/.gpg-id) and secrets in this project have been re-encrypted.
- You have an AWS IAM user with the ability to assume suitable roles.
- Your AWS configuration contains an appropriate profile wth the suitable role.
  eg.

  ```
  [profile govwifi]
  region = eu-west-1
  role_arn=arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/first-name.last-name
  mfa_serial=arn:aws:iam::1234567890:mfa/first-name.last-name@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
  ```

- You've installed Terraform version declared in the [.terraform-version file](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/blob/master/.terraform-version). This can easily be installed alongside other versions using [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv).
- (Optional) [aws-vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) is a useful AWS credential management tool. If you have other AWS credentials on you system this may help switch profiles.
- (Optional) [gds-cli](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli) can be useful for automating some of the AWS credential management. Ask the team for help setting this up.

### Running Terraform for the first time

If you are running terraform commands for the first time you'll need to initialise terraform, this involves decrypting secrets and getting the backend state from S3. This is handled by one make command:

**Note**: `env` refers to `staging | wifi | wifi-london`

```
aws-vault exec govwifi-staging -- make <env> init-backend
```
or if you are using the gds-cli:

```
gds aws govwifi-staging -- make <env> init-backend
```

Use a staging env when testing your setup, when you are confident your setup works as expected, you can then change `govwifi-staging` to `govwifi` to run in production).

After this you should be able to run `plan` to verify everything works:

```
aws-vault exec govwifi-staging -- make <env> plan
```
or if you are using the gds-cli:

```
gds aws govwifi-staging -- make <env> plan
```

You should see the confirmation message:

```
No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.
```

You're now ready to make some changes!
